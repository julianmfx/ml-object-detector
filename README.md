# Briefing

This project main goal is to develop my skills in logging, project architecture, ML pipelines, FastAPI and Docker.

# Actual

The project has a consistent pipeline that downloads images and predicts objects by executing the `ml-pipeline` code in the terminal using Bash.

# Development

The image detector will be deployed through an API using FastAPI. Then, it will containerized with Docker so that anyone can use it.
