# Briefing

This project main goal is to develop my skills on logging, project arquitechture, ML pipelines, FastAPI and Docker.

# Actual

Project have a consistent pipeline that downloads and predict image objects by executing the code `ml-pipeline` in terminal using bash.

# Development

The image detector it be deployed through a API using FastAPI. Then, it will conteneirized with Docker so that any person can use it.

# Next steps

1. Implement alarm system that warns user if a prediction is have a probability lesser than 0.1.
2. Ship through docker to test in another computers.
